Developed a comprehensive analysis of emergency 911 calls using Python and data science libraries including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Analyzed trends and patterns in emergency calls to understand reasons, geographical distribution, and peak times for emergency responses. Leveraged Pandas for data manipulation and feature engineering, resulting in insightful new columns that facilitated critical conclusions. Visualized findings using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate trends effectively.
